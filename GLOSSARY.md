## Slave

A character (usually from a popular franchise) that the player can acquire.  Untrained slaves will need to be trained to develop skills and obedience.  Trained slaves obey and assist the trainer.

## Stat

A numeric ranking of a slave's ability or prominence on a particular skill or trait.

## Task

An task dictated to a slave to help further his or her training.  A slave may refuse a task.

These are split into:

* Public Tasks: Things the slave does in a public space during the day or night.

    * Focus: A task that takes the majority of the day, such as working a job or attending a class.  Includes a mid-day break.

    * Break: What the slave will do during the short break.

* Private Tasks: Things the slave does in private during the night.

    * Foreplay: A short task intended to arouse.

    * Sex: A sexual task that culminates in climax.

## Event

An event that has a chance to occur given specific criteria (e.g. stat thresholds) and trigger (e.g. morning, evening, task start, or task completion).  Can include choices for the player.

## Flags

Qualifiers that can be used as criteria on whether a person can fulfill a task or role, e.g. `cock` flag to indicate whether a person has a cock or `lactating` flag to indicate whether a person is lactating.
