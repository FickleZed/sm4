# Stats

* Significantly simplified / consolidated.

* Slave narrative should use a combination of base stats and special stats.

* Avoid hidden stats.  Allow the player to learn how to "win".  ("Unlockable" stats that appear after a certain event are acceptable.)

# Images

* **Favor fewer images.**

* Take a "visual novel" approach to backgrounds, character sprites, and CGs.

* Resize images - stay within standard definition, e.g. 1920x1080 or ~1MB

* Don't need multiple backgrounds for the same event

* Use transparency for character sprites.

* Prefer generic character sprites instead of barely-suitable "CG"-type images for standard events.

    * Use the slave's "dress" sprite for non-explicit events and a generic "lewd" sprite for lewd events

* Use high-res CG-type images sparingly, e.g. when it is particularly apt on a standard event or is a significant event in the slave narrative.

* Keep consistency across character images.  Avoid significant variations in art style or character-defining attributes.  Exceptions can be made based on narrative.

# Slaves

* Each slave should be treated like a romancable character in a visual novel, with their own custom narrative.

* Generic content is used to pad/stretch the narrative, and does not supplant the need for a custom narrative.

    * When using generic stats in the custom narrative, include custom task messages and custom one-time events at certain stat thresholds.

* The slave or the slave's relationship with the slave maker should transition in some meaningful way from the introduction to the ending.  A given slave can have more than one such arc, though they may be mutually exclusive branches in the narrative.

    * This can be driven by the slave's owner requesting specific training, the slave herself wanting specific training, or the slave maker's idea on how to train this particular slave.

* The "dress" sprites should correlate with the narrative.

* Consider comissioning art if needed.

* Examples:

    * A warrior woman pledged herself to a person who saved her life.  This person uses the pledge to make her a slave.  The slave starts out highly capable in combat, but coarse in social situations and didn't intend her pledge to include sex.  The slave is taught that the true way to honor her pledge is to allow her owner to user her body in all ways, finding pleasure in femininity and submission.
    
    * A woman approaches the slave maker with the dream of becoming a pop idol, and wants the slave maker to help train her.  The slave is clumsy and shy, but has natural singing talent and determination.  The slave maker not only trains her social, dance, and stage presence, but also encourages progressive exhibitionist tasks.

    * The slave maker acquires a slave from the market, but she insists that she has a refined pallette for food and drink.  The slave maker decides to focus on giving her a taste for cum until it becomes her favorite dish.
